          <p>Now established as one of the most successful Livery and Equine Coaching centres in the country,
            Embarr Equestrian in Co. Meath, Ireland is set on 120 acres of rolling parkland.<br><br>Owned by the Jordan family, 
            the name is inspired by the mythical horse named "Embarr" a Gaelic word that means "imagination." <br>
            In mythology, this is the name of the heroine Niamh's magical 
            horse that could cross the sea and land without touching the water or the ground.</p>
